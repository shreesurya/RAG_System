It is the\\nmost valuable inheritance of the present. It is the essential\\nneed of today and the culture oftomorrow.”\\nSwami Satyananda Saraswati\\nYoga is the science of right living and, as such, is intended to be\\nincorporated in daily life. It works on all aspects of the person: the\\nphysical, vital, mental, emotional, psychic and spiritual.\\nThe word yoga means ‘unity* or ‘oneness* and is derived from\\nSanskrit yuj which means ‘to join’. This unity or joining is\\ndescribed in spiritual terms as the un ion of the individual\\nconsciousness with the universal consciousness. On a more\\npractical level, yoga is a means of balancing and harmonizing the\\nbody, mind and emotions. This is done through the pr actice of\\nasana, pranayama, mudra , bandha, shatkarma and meditation,\\nand must be achieved before union can takeplace with the higher\\nreality.\\nThe science of yoga begins to w ork on the outermost aspec t of\\ndie personality, the physical body, which fo r most people is a\\npractical and familiar starting point. When imbalance i s\\nexperiencedat this level, the organs, muscles and nervesno longer\\nfunction in harmony, rather they act in opposition, to each other.\\nFor instance, the endocrine system might become irregular and\\nthe efficiency of the nervous system decrease to such an extent\\nthat a disease wil l manifest.

Through the practices of yoga, awareness\\ndevelops of the interrelation between t he emotional, mental and\\nphysical levels, and how a disturbance in any one of these affects the\\nothers.

In the last half of this\\ncentury, hatha yoga has become the most well known and widely\\npracticed of the systems. However, the concept of what constitutes\\nyoga is broadening as more people take it up, and this knowledge is\\nspreading. In the ancient texts, hatha yoga consists of the shatkarmas,\\ncleansing practices, only. Today, however, hatha yoga commonly\\nembraces the practices of asana, pranayama, mudra and bandha as\\nwell.\\nHistory of yoga\\nThe yoga we know today was developed as part of the tantric\\ncivilization which existed in India and all parts of the world more\\nthan ten thousand years ago. In archaeological excavations made in\\nthe Indus Valley at Harappa and Mohenjodaro, now in modern\\nPakistan, many statues have been found depicting deities resembling\\nLord Shiva and Parvati performing various asanas and practicing\\nmeditation. These ruins were once the dwelling place of people who\\nlived in the pre -vedic age before the Aryan civilization started to\\nflourish in the Indus subcontinent. According to mythical tradition,\\nShiva is said to be the founder of yoga and Parvati, hi s first disciple.\\n2'),\n",

It is one of the special\\ncontributions of Bihar School of Yoga and the teachings of\\nParamahamsa Satyananda. Being the first practical series taught in\\nhatha yoga, it is essential for laying a firm foundation in yogic life.\\nPawanmuktasana is valuable for understanding the meaning of asana by\\ndeveloping awareness of the body’s movements and the subtle effects\\nthey have at the various levels of being. It is very useful as a\\npreparatory practice as it opens up all the major joints and relaxes the\\nmuscles of the body. The series may be practiced by anyone: beginner\\nor advanced, young or elderly, and by th ose convalescing or with\\ndisease conditions. It should never be ignored and treated casually just\\nbecause the practices are simple, gentle and comfortable.\\nIn Sanskrit these practices are referred to as sukshmavyayama which\\nmeans ‘ subtle exercise’. The wo rd pawan means “wind’ or ‘ prana’;\\nmukta means ‘release ’ and asana means ‘pose’. Therefore,\\npawanmuktasana also means a group of asana s that remove any\\nblockages which prevent the free f low of energy in the b ody and mind.\\nSometimes, due to bad posture, disturbed bodily functions,\\npsychological or emotional prob lems or an imbalanced lifestyle, the\\nenergy becomes blocked.

Regular practice of\\npawanmuktasana removes energy blockages from the body and prevents\\nnew ones from forming. In this way, it promotes total health, regulating\\nand stabilizing the flow of energy throughout the body.\\nMind-body aspect\\nMost modern day diseases are psychosomatic in nature. Drug treatment\\nof these ailments is only symptomatic and fails to touch the roots of the\\ndisease. These asanas, if done correctly, in a non -competitive and\\nrelaxed atmosphere, not only relax the muscles of the body but these\\nrelaxing impulses travel back to the brain and relax the mind. By\\nintegrating the breath synchronization and awareness, the atten tive\\nfaculty of the mind is made active and is not allowed to wander into\\ntension and stress. The nature of these asanas is thus more mental than\\nphysical. If they are performedcorrectly they relax the mind, tune up the\\nautonomic nerves, hormonal functions and the activities of internal\\norgans. Therefore, these asanas are of great preventative and curative\\nvalue.\\nThree groups\\nPawanmuktasana is divided into three distinct groups of asanas: the\\nanti-rheumatic group, the digestive/abdominal group and the shakt i\\nbandha or energy block group. All three groups^supplement each other,\\nstimulating and encouraging a free flow of energy throughout the body.\\nPractitioners are advised to perfect each group before attempting the\\nmajor asanas. Daily practice of pawanmuktasana parts 1, 2 and 3 over a\\nperiod of months brings about a profound relaxation and toning of the\\nentire psycho-physiological structure which is necessary for the practice\\nof advanced techniques. Advanced yogasanas are frequently physically\\ndemanding and have a powerful effect on the body and mind. It is\\nessential to respect this and prepare correctly. The asanas in each\\ngroup should be performed in theorder given.\\n22'),\n",

Only when the body has been steady\\nand still for some time will meditation be experienced. Deep\\nmeditation requires the spinal column to be straight and very few\\nasanas can satisfy this condition. Furthermore, in high stages of\\nmeditation the practitioner loses control over the muscles of the\\nbody. The meditation asana, therefore, needs to hold the body in a\\nsteady position without conscious effort. Why not lie in shavasana,\\nthen, for meditation since it satisfies all the requirements? Because\\nin shavasana there is a tendency to drift into sleep. It is essential to\\nremain awake and alert while going through the various stages\\nwhich lead to successful meditation.\\nSwami Sivananda of Rishikesh said the following about asanas\\nand meditation: “You must be able to sit in one of the meditation\\nasanas for a full three hours at a stretch without the body shaking.\\nThen only will you gain true asana siddhi,mastery over the asana,\\nand be able to practice the higher stages of pranayama and dhyana.\\nWithout securing a steady asana you cannot progress well in\\nmeditation.

However, there is one extra asana, ardha\\nchandrasana or the half moon pose, which emphasizes the link with\\nthe lunar energies set up by the preparatory visualizations. Also, in\\nchandra namaskara the force of each asana is changed sub tly by the\\nrepetition of mantras related to the lunar energies.\\nIn the chandra namaskara sequence of fourteen postures move from\\nposition 4, ashwa sanchalana, into ardha chandrasana position 5, as\\ndescribed opposite.

They are stimulating and extroverting. Because they\\nexpand the chest and encourage inhalation, they are associated with\\nthe attitude of embracing life. They are also dynamic postures which\\nmove counter to gravity and, therefore, require strength and energy\\nto perform.\\nSome people are known to bend over backwards to please others\\nand these people often have the same ability on the physical level.\\nThose who have difficulty in bending backwards, may be frightened\\nto face life and give of themselves with love. These common fears\\nare instinctual or due to unpleasant past experie nces. This psychic\\nstiffness dampens spontaneity and adversely affects the external\\npersonality. It translates itself via the brain and nervous system into\\nthe body and is called ‘body armor’. Backward bending asanas\\nbreak down this body armor. Their effects reach far into the depths\\nof the mental and psychic bodies, helping to remold and reshape the\\npersonality.\\nOn a physical level, the backward bending asanas stretch the\\nabdominal muscles and tone and strengthen the muscles controlling\\nthe spine, helpi ng prevent slipped disc and other back conditions.\\nThe spinal nerves, which emerge from between the adjoining\\nvertebrae, are also toned. This has beneficial repercussions\\nthroughout the body since these nerves give energy to all the other\\nnerves, organs and muscles in the body-\\nThe spinal column is a ‘stacked pile’ of vertebrae and discs.\\nGroups of muscles extend all along it, covering and support ing it\\nfrom all sides.

It is a process of introversion, counteracting the extroversion and\\ndynamic opening up of bending backwards. Forward bending, asso -\\nciated with chest compression and exhalation, induces relaxation.\\nMany people lead sedentary lifestyles withlittle or no exercise and, as\\na result, the body becomes stiff and unable to bend forward. City living\\nencourages mental tension and physical rigidi ty both of which are\\ncounteracted by forward bending asanas. At ano ther level, forward\\nbending is associated with bowing and humility. An inability to bend\\nforward may indicate a stiff, proud or stubborn personality. Difficulty\\nbending forward is also as sociated with fear. Human beings face\\nforward to see the world. The place behind us, however, is defined by\\nobscure sounds, smells and sensations, and it is necessary to turn\\naround to be sure of what is taking place. Some people live in constant\\nfear of attack from behind and the backs of their bodies unconsciously\\nfreeze. Forward bending asanas release this rigidity.\\nForward bending asanas loosen up the back, maintaining good health\\nand increasing vitality.

Most people are uncoordinated in their\\nmovements so their bodies constantly have to compensate for their lack of\\nbalance in order to avoid falling or knocking things over. This inefficient\\nmethod of proceeding expends maximum effort and energy for the\\nminimum results, creating considerable additional st rain on the body.\\nThese asanas induce physical balance, stilling unconscious movement. As\\nthe moving body attains balance it becomes increasingly free to rely on\\nother forces, such as gravity, to support and propel it. This way it\\nconserves its own energyand achieves grace and fluidity of motion.\\nAs well as inducing physical balance, this group of practices develops a\\nbalanced mind and a more mature outlook on life. The focus required to\\nperform them with steadiness develops concentration and balance at th e\\nemotional, mental and psychic levels. These asanas are especially noted\\nfor balancing the nervous system and removing stress and anxiety. For\\nrelief of excessive tension these practices should be held for as long as\\npossible.\\nBalancing asanas may be diff icult to perform at first if one’s sense of\\nbalance has not been developed in normal life. However, the body is very\\nadaptable and progress will quickly be made with a few weeks of regular\\npractice. When practicing these asanas it is most important to ste ady the\\nmind through concentration on one point. Gazing at a black spot or a mark\\non the wall while balancing allows the body to maintain seemingly\\ndifficult positions for long periods of time.\\n290'),\n",

It induces introversion, mental\\nrelaxation, composure and a sense of inner security and surrender.\\nPassion, fear and anger subside, and the body and mind are refreshed\\nthrough this practice.\\nNote: This asana prepares the spiritual aspirant for the fifth stage of yogic\\npractice, pratyahara, sense withdrawal, which is symbolized by the\\ntortoise. TheBhagavad Gita states, “When he (the yogic aspirant) can\\nwithdraw his senses from association with other objects, as a tortoise\\nwithdraws its limbsfrom external danger, then he is firmly fixed on the\\npath towards wisdom.” (2:58) Koormasana is dedicated to Koorma, the\\ntortoise incarnation of Lord Vishnu, maintainer of the universe.\\n329'),\n",

Although this\\ninterpretation may seem correct in view of the practices involved, it does\\nnot convey the full meaning of the term. The word pranayama is\\ncomprised of two roots: prana plus ayama. Prana means ‘vital energy’ or\\n‘life force’. It is the force which exists in all things, whether animate or\\ninanimate. Although closely related to the air we breathe, it is more subtle\\nthan air or oxygen. Therefore, pranayama should not be considered as\\nmere breathing exercises aimed at introducing extra oxygen into the\\nlungs. Pranayama utilizes breathing to influence the flow of prana in the\\nnadis or energy channels of the pranamayakosha or energy body.\\nThe word yama means ‘control’ and is used to denote various rules or\\ncodes of conduct. However, this is not the word which is joined to prana\\nto form pranayama; the correct word is ayama which has far more\\nimplications than the word yama. Ayama is de fined as ‘extension’ or\\n‘expansion’. Thus, the word pranayama means ‘extension or expansion of\\nthe dimension of prana’. The techniques of pranayama provide the\\nmethod whereby the life force can be activated and regulated in order to\\ngo beyond one’s normal boundaries or limitations and attain a higher state\\nof vibratory energy.\\nFour aspects of pranayama\\nIn the pranayama practices there are four important aspects of breathing\\nwhich are utilized. These are:\\na) Pooraka or inhalation\\nb) Rechaka or exhalation\\n363'),\n",

There it another mode of pranayama\\nwhich it called kevala kumbhakaor spontaneous breath retention. This is\\nan advanced stage of pranayama which occurs during high states of\\nmeditation. During this state, the lungs stop their activity and the\\nrespiration ceases. At this time, the veil which prevents one from seeing\\nthe subtle aspect of existence is lifted and a higher vision of reality is\\nattained.\\nThe most important part of pranayama is actually kumbhaka or breath\\nretention. However, in order to perform kumbhaka successfully, there\\nmust be a gradual development of control over the function of respiration.\\nTherefore, in the pranayama practices more emphasis is given to\\ninhalation and exhalation at the beginning, in order to strengthen the lungs\\nand balance the nervous and pranic systems in preparation for the practice\\nof kumbhaka. These practices influence the flow of prana in the nadis,\\npurifying, regulating and activating t hem, thereby inducing physical and\\nmental stability. (For more information on nadis see the chapter Psychic\\nPhysiology of Yoga.)\\nThe pranic body\\nAccording to yogic physiology, the human framework is comprised of five\\nbodies or sheaths, which account for the different aspects or dimensions of\\nhuman existence. These five sheaths are known as:\\na) Annamayakosha,the food or material body\\nb) Manomaya kosha,the mental body\\nc) Pranamaya kosha,the bioplasmic or vital energy body\\nd) Vijnanamaya kosha,the psychic or higher mental body\\ne) Anandamaya kosha,the transcendental or bliss body.\\nAlthough these five sheaths function together to form an\\nintegral whole, the practices of pranayama work mainly with pranamaya\\nkosha. The pranamaya kosha is made up of five major pranas which are\\ncollectively known as the pancha, or five, pranas: prana, apana, samana,\\nudana and vyana.\\n364'),\n",

It influences the activities\\nof each and every cell and, most importantly, is intimately linked with the\\nperformance of the brain. Human beings breathe about 15 times per minute\\nand 21,600 times per day.

The breath is intimately linked to all aspects\\nof human experience.\\nMost people breathe incorrectly, using only a small part of their lung\\ncapacity. The breathing is then generally shallow, depriving the body of\\noxygen and prana essential to its good health. The first five practices given\\nin this section are preparatory techniques which introduce correct breathing\\nhabits. In addition, they help focus the awareness on the breathing process,\\nwhich is otherwise normally ignored. Practitioners develop sensitivity t o\\nthe respiratory process and retrain the muscles of the pulmonary cavity,\\nenhancing their vital capacity and preparing them for pranayama.\\nRhythmic, deep and slow respiration stimulates and is stimulated by calm,\\ncontent states of mind.

The ancient yogis and rishis\\nstudied nature in great detail. They noticed that animals with a slow breath\\nrate such as pythons, elephants and tortoises have long life spans, whereas\\nthose with a fast breathing rate, such as bird s, dogs and rabbits, live for\\nonly a few years. From this observation they realized the importance of\\nslow breathing for increasing the human lifespan. Those who breathe in\\nshort, quick gasps are likely to have a shorter life span than those who\\nbreathe sl owly and deeply. On the physical level, this is because the\\nrespiration is directly related to the heart. A slow breathing rate keeps th e\\nheart stronger and better nourished and contributes to a longer life. Deep\\nbreathing also increases the absorption of energy by the pranamaya kosha,\\nenhancing dynamism, vitality and general wellbeing.\\nPranayama and the spiritual aspirant\\nPranayama practices establish a healthy body by removing blockages in the\\npranamaya kosha, enabling an increased absorption of prana. Th e spiritual\\nseeker, however, also requires tranquility of mind as an essential prelude to\\nspiritual practice. To this end, many pranayama techniques utilize\\nkumbhaka, breath retention, to establish control over the flow of prana,\\ncalming the mind and controlling the thought process.\\nOnce the mind has been stilled and prana flows freely in the nadis and\\nchakras, the doorway to the evolution of con sciousness opens, leading the\\naspirant into higher dimensions of spiritual experience. In The Science of\\nPranayama, Swami Sivananda writes, “There is an intimate connection\\nbetween the breath, nerve currents and control of the inner prana or vital\\nforces. Prana becomes visible on the physical plane as motion and action,\\n368\\nand on the mental plane as thought.'),\n",

The main points are to exercise moderation,\\nbalance and common sense with regard to inner and outer thinking and\\nliving. However, for those who seriously wish to take up the advanced\\npractices of pranayama, the guidance of a guru or experienced teacher is\\nessential.\\nBreathing: Always breathe through the nose and not the mouth unless\\nspecifically instructed otherwise. The nose should be cleaned regularly by\\njala neti prior to the practice session. Be aware of the nostrils throughout\\nthe techniques. While inhaling, the nostrils should dilate or expand\\noutwards and while exhaling, they should relax back to their normal\\nposition.\\nTime of practice:The best time to practice pranayama is during the early\\nmorning when the body is fresh and the mind has very few impressions. If\\nthis is not possible, another good time is just after sunset. Tranquillizing\\npranayamas may be performed before sleep. Try topractice regularly at the\\nsame time and place each day. Regularity in practice increases strength and\\nwillpower as well as acclimatizing the body and mind to the increased\\npranic force. Do not be in a hurry; slow, steady progress is essential.\\nPlace of practice: Practice in a quiet, clean and pleasan t room which is\\nwell ventilated but not draughty. Generally, avoid practicing in direct\\nsunlight, as the body will become over -heated, except at dawn when the\\nsoft rays of the early morning sun are beneficial. Practicing in a draught or\\nwind, in air -conditioning or under a fan may upset the body temper ature\\nand cause chills.\\nSitting position: A comfortable, sustainable meditation posture is\\nnecessary to enable efficient breathing and body steadiness during the\\npractice.

The bandhas aim\\nto lock the pranas in par ticular areas and redirect their flow into\\nsushumna nadi for the purpose of spiritual awakening.\\nBandhas may be practiced individually or incorporated with mudra\\nand pranayama practices.

These three bandhas directly\\nact on the three granthisor psychic knots. Moola bandha is associated\\nwith brahma granthi, uddiyana bandha with vishnu granthi and\\njalandhara bandha with rudra granthi.

Yogis have experienced mudras as attitudes of\\nenergy flow, intended to link individual pranic force with universal or\\ncosmic force.” The KularnavaTantra traces the word mudra to the root\\nmud meaning ‘delight’ or ‘pleasure’ and dravay,the causal form of\\ndru which mea ns ‘to draw forth’. Mudra is also defined as a ‘seal,’\\n‘short-cut’ or ‘circuit by-pass.’\\nMudras are a combination of subtle physical movements which alter\\nmood, attitude and perception, and which deepen awareness and\\nconcentration. A mudra may involve the w hole body in a combination\\nof asana, pranayama, bandha and visualization techniques or it may be a\\nsimple hand position. The Hatha Yoga Pradipikaand other yogic texts\\nconsider mudra to be a yoganda, an independent branch of yoga,\\nrequiring a very subtle awareness. Mudras are introduced after some\\nproficiency has been attained in asana, pranayama and bandha, and\\ngross blockages have been removed.\\nMudras have been described in various texts from antiquity to the\\npresent day in order to preserve them for poste rity. However, such\\nreferences were never detailed or clearly delineated as these techniques\\nwere not intended to be learned from a book. Practical instruction from\\na guru was always considered to be a necessary requisite before\\nattempting them. Mudras are higher practices which lead to awakening\\nof the pranas, chakras and kundalini, and which can bestow major\\nsiddhis,psychic powers, on the advanced practitioner.\\n423'),\n",

Ultimately, it establishes pranic balance within the\\nkoshas and enables the redirection of subtle energy to the upper\\nchakras, inducing higher states of consciousness.\\nMudras manipulate prana in much the same way that energy in the\\nform of light or sound waves is diverted by a mirror or a cliff face . The\\nnadis and chakras constantl y radiate prana which normally escapes\\nfrom the body and dissipates into the external world. B y creating\\nbarriers within the body through the practice of mudra, the energy is\\nredirected within. For example, by closing the eyes with the fingers in\\nshanmukhi mudra, the prana being radiated through the eyes is\\nreflected back. In the same way, the sexu al energy emitted through\\nvajra nadi is redirected to the brain through the practice of vajroli\\nmudra.\\nTantric literature states that once the dissipation of prana is arrested\\nthrough the practice of mudra, the mind becomes introverted, inducing\\nstates of pratyahara, or sense withdrawal and dharana, concentration.\\nBecause of their ability to redirect prana, mudras are important\\ntechniques for awakening kundalini. For this reason they are\\nextensively incorporated in kriya and kundalini yoga practices.\\nA scientific look at mudras\\nIn scientific terms, mudras provide a means to access and influence the\\nunconscious reflexes and primal, instinctive habit patterns that originate\\nin the primitive areas of the brain around the brain stem. They establish\\na subtle, non -intellectual connection with these areas. Each mudra sets\\nup a different link and has a correspondingly different effect on the\\nbody, mind and prana. The aim is to create fixed, repetitive postures\\nand gestures which can snap the practitioner out of instinc tive habit\\npatterns and establish a more refined consciousness.\\n424'),\n",

Regular practice of\\nshambhavi mudra retards degeneration of the pineal gland and is\\ntherefore recommended for children from the age of eight onwards to\\nbalance their emotional development.\\nAdvanced practice:(internal shambhavi mudra)\\nOnce shambhavi mudra has been mastered with the eyes open, it may\\nbe performed with the eyes closed. This is a more powerful practice\\nbecause the awareness is more internalized. Be careful not to relax the\\neyes and stop the practice without being aware of it. Always ensure\\nthat, although the e yes are closed, they are still gazing upward\\ninternally.\\nPractice note: Shambhavi mudra is an integral part of kriya yoga. It is a\\npowerful technique for awakening ajna chakra and is a meditation\\npractice in its own right. As such it may produce profound e xperiences\\nwhen performed for long periods of time; however, it should only be\\nperformed under the guidance of a guru. Shambhavi mudra is also\\nincorporated in asanas such as simhasana, the lion pose.\\n434'),\n",

The literal meaning of the word swadhisthana is \\n‘one’s own abode.’  The Sanskrit word swa means ‘self’ and sthan means \\n‘dwelling place.’ This chakra is symbol ized by a crimson lotus with six \\npetals. In the centre is a white crescent moon, the yantra of apas tattwa,\\nthe water element, and the beeja mantra vam. The crescent moon yantra \\nand beeja mantra are riding on a crocodile, symbolising the subterranean \\nmovement of the karmas. \\nSwadhisthana chakra is associated with seeking pleasure through the \\ntongue and genital organs. Whereas material security is sought in \\nmooladhara chakra, in swadhisthana the emphasis is on enjoyment, on the \\npleasurable sensations associated with food and drink and sexual \\ninteraction. When swadhisthana becomes active, it may manifest as \\noverwhelming desires or cravings for these things. On the physical level, \\nswadhisthana is associated with the organs of excretion and reproduction. \\nVisualization of this center can help rectify disorders of these functions. \\nOn a deeper level, swadhisthana chakra is the seat of the individual and \\ncollective unconscious; it is the storehouse of all samskaras, past mental \\nimpressions stored in the form of archetypes. It is the centre of \\nhumankind’s most primitive and deep-rooted instincts. By purifying this \\ncentre the animal nature is transcended. \\n516'),\n",

On the negative \\nside, this may be expressed in despotism and in seeing things and people \\nmerely as a means to gain personal power or to satisfy personal needs. \\nThe solar plexus is the center chiefly concerned with the vital process of \\ndigestion and food metabolism. It gove rns the functioning of the gastric \\nglands, the pancreas, gall bladder and so on, which produce and secrete \\nenzymes, adds and juices necessary for the digestion and absorption of \\nnutrients.

They secrete adrenaline into the blood during an emergency \\nsituation. This has the effect of speeding up all the physiological processes, \\nmaking the mind sharp and alert, the he art beat faster, the respiration rate \\nmore rapid and so on. The body is then prepared for a more intense level of \\nactivity than normal in what is commonly called the ‘fight or flight’ reaction. \\nThose people who suffer from sluggishness and depression or malfunctions \\nof the digestive system, such as diabetes and indigestion, should concentrate \\non manipura chakra and try to feel energy radiating from this region. \\nFor concentration on this centre, visualize the blazing sun or a ball of fire. \\nExperience energy in the form of light radiating from this region and \\npermeating the whole body. \\n517\"),\n",

His ancestors were warriors and many of his kith \\nand kin down the line, including his fa ther, served in the army and police \\nforce. \\nHowever, it became evident that Sri Swamiji had a different bent o f \\nmind, as he began to have spiritual e xperiences at the age of six, when his \\nawareness spontaneously left the body and he saw himself lying motionless \\non the floor. Many saints and sadhus blessed him and reassured his parents \\nthat he had a very developed awaren ess. This experience of disembodied \\nawareness continued, which led him to many saints of that time such as \\nAnandamayi Ma. Sri Swamiji also met a tantric bhairavi, Sukhman Giri, \\nwho gave him shaktipat and directed him to find a guru in order to stabilize \\nhis spiritual experiences. \\nIn 1943, at the age of 20, he renounced his home and went in search of a \\nguru. This search ultimately led him to Swami Sivananda Saraswati at \\nRishikesh, who initiated him into the Dashnam Order of Sannyasa on 12th \\nSeptember 1947 on the banks of the Ganges and gave him the name Swami \\nSatyananda Saraswati. \\nIn those early years at Rishikesh, Sr i Swamiji immersed himself in guru \\nseva. At that time the ashram was s till in its infancy and even the basic \\namenities such as buildings and toilets were absent. The forests \\nsurrounding the small ashram were infested with snakes, scorpions, \\nmosquitoes, monkeys and even tigers. The ashram work too was heavy and \\nhard, requiring Sri Swamiji to toil like a laborer carrying bucket loads o f \\nwater from the Ganga up to the ashr am and digging canals from the high \\nmountain streams down to the ashram ma ny kilometers away in order to \\nstore water for constructing the ashram. \\nRishikesh was then a small town and all the ashram requirements had to \\nbe brought by foot from far away. In addition there were varied duties, \\nincluding the daily pooja at Vishwanath'),\n",

If anyone fell sick there was no medical care and no one to attend to \\nthem. All the sannyasins had to go out for bhiksha or alms as the ashram did \\nnot have a mess or kitchen. \\nOf that glorious time when he lived and served his guru, Sri Swamiji says \\nthat it was a period of total communi on and surrender to the guru tattwa, \\nwhereby he felt that just to hear, speak or see Swami Sivananda was yoga. \\nBut most of all his guru\\'s words rang true, for through this dedication and \\nspirit of nishkama seva he gained an enlightened understanding of the secrets \\nof spiritual life and became an authority on Yoga, Tantra, Vedanta, Samkhya \\nand kundalini yoga. Swami Sivananda said of Swami Satyananda, \"Few \\nwould exhibit such intense vairagya at such an early age. Swami Satyananda \\nis full of Nachiketa vairagya.\" \\nAlthough he had a photographic memory and a keen intellect, and his guru \\ndescribed him as a versatile genius, Swami Satyananda\\'s learning did not \\ncome from books and study in the ashram. His knowledge unfolded from \\nwithin through his untiring seva as we ll as his abiding faith and love for \\nSwami Sivananda, who told him, \"Work hard and you will be purified. You \\ndo not have to search for the light, the light will unfold from within you.\" \\nIn 1956, after spending twelve years in guru seva, Swami Satyananda set \\nout as a wanderer (parivrajaka). Be fore his departure Swami Sivananda \\ntaught him kriya yoga and gave him the mission to \"spread yoga from door to \\ndoor and shore to shore\". \\nAs a wandering sannyasin, Swami Satyananda travelled extensively by foot, \\ncar, train and sometimes even by camel throughout India, Afghanistan,\\nBurma, Nepal, Tibet, Ceylon and the entire Asian subcontinent. During his \\nsojourns, he met people from all stratas of society and began formulating his \\nideas on how to spread the yogic techniques. Although his formal education \\nand spiritual tradition was that of Vedanta, the task of disseminating yoga \\nbecame his movement.'),\n",
