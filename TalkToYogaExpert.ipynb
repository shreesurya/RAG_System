It works on all aspects of the person: the\\nphysical, vital, mental, emotional, psychic and spiritual.\\nThe word yoga means ‘unity* or ‘oneness* and is derived from\\nSanskrit yuj which means ‘to join’. This unity or joining is\\ndescribed in spiritual terms as the un ion of the individual\\nconsciousness with the universal consciousness. On a more\\npractical level, yoga is a means of balancing and harmonizing the\\nbody, mind and emotions. This is done through the pr actice of\\nasana, pranayama, mudra , bandha, shatkarma and meditation,\\nand must be achieved before union can takeplace with the higher\\nreality.\\nThe science of yoga begins to w ork on the outermost aspec t of\\ndie personality, the physical body, which fo r most people is a\\npractical and familiar starting point. When imbalance i s\\nexperiencedat this level, the organs, muscles and nervesno longer\\nfunction in harmony, rather they act in opposition, to each other.\\nFor instance, the endocrine system might become irregular and\\nthe efficiency of the nervous system decrease to such an extent\\nthat a disease wil l manifest.

Through the practices of yoga, awareness\\ndevelops of the interrelation between t he emotional, mental and\\nphysical levels, and how a disturbance in any one of these affects the\\nothers.

In the last half of this\\ncentury, hatha yoga has become the most well known and widely\\npracticed of the systems. However, the concept of what constitutes\\nyoga is broadening as more people take it up, and this knowledge is\\nspreading. In the ancient texts, hatha yoga consists of the shatkarmas,\\ncleansing practices, only. Today, however, hatha yoga commonly\\nembraces the practices of asana, pranayama, mudra and bandha as\\nwell.\\nHistory of yoga\\nThe yoga we know today was developed as part of the tantric\\ncivilization which existed in India and all parts of the world more\\nthan ten thousand years ago. In archaeological excavations made in\\nthe Indus Valley at Harappa and Mohenjodaro, now in modern\\nPakistan, many statues have been found depicting deities resembling\\nLord Shiva and Parvati performing various asanas and practicing\\nmeditation.

Implicit in the concept of awareness is the idea of acceptance\\nof any thought which comes uninvited to the mind; ‘good’ and ‘bad’\\nthoughts should be accepted equally, without judgment. In the fi nal\\nanalysis, thoughts are ener gy, neither good nor bad . This awareness is\\nessential in order to receive optimum benefits from the practices.\\nRelaxation: Shavasana may be performed at any point during asana\\npractice, especially when feeling physically or\\n14'),\n",

This\\nconcept of counterpose is necessary to bring the body back to a balanced\\nstate. Specific counterposes are recommended for certain asanas described\\nin this book. However, in some cases, when practicing a particular asana\\nfor therapeutic reasons, a counterpose may not be needed.\\nTime of practice : Asana may be practiced at any time of day except\\nafter meals. The best time, however, is the two hours before and including\\nsunrise. This period of the day is known in Sanskrit as brahmamuhurtaand\\nis most c onducive to the higher practices of yoga. At this time, the\\natmosphere is pure and quiet, the activities of the stomach and intestines\\nhave stopped, the mind has no deep impressions on the conscious level\\nand it is empty of thoughts in preparation for the long day ahead. The\\npractitioner will probably find that the muscles are stiffest early in the\\nmorning compared to the late afternoon when they become more supple,\\nnevertheless this time is recommended for practice. In the evening the two\\nhours around sunset is also a favorable time.\\nPlace of practice : Practice in a well -ventilated room where it is calm\\nand quiet. Asanas may also be practiced outdoors but the surroundings\\nshould be pleasant, a beautiful garden with trees and flowers, for example.\\nDo not practice in a strong wind, in the cold, in air that is dirty, smoky or\\nwhich carries an unpleasant odor. Do not practice in the vicinity of\\nfurniture, a fire or anything that prevents free fall to the ground, especially\\nwhile performing asanas such as sirs hasana. Many accidents occur\\nbecause people fall against an object. Do not practice under an electric fan\\nunless it is extremely hot.\\n15'),\n",

Before commencing, remove spectacles, wristwatches and any\\njewelry.\\nBathing: Try to take a cold shower before starting. This will\\ngreatly improve the effect of the asanas.\\nEmptying the bowels : Before commencing the asana program, the\\nbladder and intestines should preferably be empty.

Being the first practical series taught in\\nhatha yoga, it is essential for laying a firm foundation in yogic life.\\nPawanmuktasana is valuable for understanding the meaning of asana by\\ndeveloping awareness of the body’s movements and the subtle effects\\nthey have at the various levels of being. It is very useful as a\\npreparatory practice as it opens up all the major joints and relaxes the\\nmuscles of the body. The series may be practiced by anyone: beginner\\nor advanced, young or elderly, and by th ose convalescing or with\\ndisease conditions.

Drug treatment\\nof these ailments is only symptomatic and fails to touch the roots of the\\ndisease. These asanas, if done correctly, in a non -competitive and\\nrelaxed atmosphere, not only relax the muscles of the body but these\\nrelaxing impulses travel back to the brain and relax the mind. By\\nintegrating the breath synchronization and awareness, the atten tive\\nfaculty of the mind is made active and is not allowed to wander into\\ntension and stress. The nature of these asanas is thus more mental than\\nphysical. If they are performedcorrectly they relax the mind, tune up the\\nautonomic nerves, hormonal functions and the activities of internal\\norgans. Therefore, these asanas are of great preventative and curative\\nvalue.\\nThree groups\\nPawanmuktasana is divided into three distinct groups of asanas: the\\nanti-rheumatic group, the digestive/abdominal group and the shakt i\\nbandha or energy block group. All three groups^supplement each other,\\nstimulating and encouraging a free flow of energy throughout the body.\\nPractitioners are advised to perfect each group before attempting the\\nmajor asanas. Daily practice of pawanmuktasana parts 1, 2 and 3 over a\\nperiod of months brings about a profound relaxation and toning of the\\nentire psycho-physiological structure which is necessary for the practice\\nof advanced techniques.

Diet,\\nhowever, is more complex and it affects not only the health of the eyes\\nbut of the whole body. Simp lifying the diet and avoiding heavy,\\nindigestible, oily, spicy foods as well as tinned, processed, pre -packed\\nand junk foods will help rectify poor vision. A vegetarian diet is also\\nrecommended or, at least, a reduction of non-vegetarian food.\\nContrary to popular belief, long periods of reading do not damage the\\neyes providing the mind and eyes are relaxed whilst doing so. If there is\\ntension, then even a short period of reading can strain the eyes. Try to\\ndevelop the ability to read with relaxed awareness and a good posture.\\nBefore starting to read, if mental or muscular tension is experienced in\\nthe eyes, perform shashankasana for a few minutes. This asana will do\\nmuch to calm the mind and relax the eyes.\\nTry to depend less on the use of glasses. Use them only when it is\\nabsolutely necessary. Leave them off during leisure time whenever\\npossible. This will help the eyes to adjust and start functioning\\nnormally.\\n74'),\n",

This is due to the reflex\\nconnections between the soles of the feet and the visual areas of the\\nbrain. It is especially recommended where the feet are often in restrictive\\nfootwear.\\nAnother exercise recommended for relaxing the eye muscles is to stand\\nwith the feet shoulder width apart in front of a wide open space. Shift the\\nweight of the body onto one side, raise the opposite heel off the ground,\\nthen swing back and forth for a few minutes while gazing into the\\ndistance, allowing the eyes to relax.\\nGazing at the rising sun during the first 15 degrees of its trajectory from\\nthe horizon is highly recommended.

Only when the body has been steady\\nand still for some time will meditation be experienced. Deep\\nmeditation requires the spinal column to be straight and very few\\nasanas can satisfy this condition. Furthermore, in high stages of\\nmeditation the practitioner loses control over the muscles of the\\nbody. The meditation asana, therefore, needs to hold the body in a\\nsteady position without conscious effort. Why not lie in shavasana,\\nthen, for meditation since it satisfies all the requirements? Because\\nin shavasana there is a tendency to drift into sleep. It is essential to\\nremain awake and alert while going through the various stages\\nwhich lead to successful meditation.\\nSwami Sivananda of Rishikesh said the following about asanas\\nand meditation: “You must be able to sit in one of the meditation\\nasanas for a full three hours at a stretch without the body shaking.\\nThen only will you gain true asana siddhi,mastery over the asana,\\nand be able to practice the higher stages of pranayama and dhyana.\\nWithout securing a steady asana you cannot progress well in\\nmeditation. The more steady you are in your asana, the more you\\nwill be able to concentrate with a one-pointed mind. If you can be\\nsteady in a posture even for one hour, you will be able to acquire a\\none- pointed mind and feel the atmic anandam,infinite peace and\\nsoulful bliss inside you.”\\nInitially, most people will find it difficult to sit in one asana for a\\nlong time.

It is a process of introversion, counteracting the extroversion and\\ndynamic opening up of bending backwards. Forward bending, asso -\\nciated with chest compression and exhalation, induces relaxation.\\nMany people lead sedentary lifestyles withlittle or no exercise and, as\\na result, the body becomes stiff and unable to bend forward. City living\\nencourages mental tension and physical rigidi ty both of which are\\ncounteracted by forward bending asanas. At ano ther level, forward\\nbending is associated with bowing and humility. An inability to bend\\nforward may indicate a stiff, proud or stubborn personality. Difficulty\\nbending forward is also as sociated with fear. Human beings face\\nforward to see the world. The place behind us, however, is defined by\\nobscure sounds, smells and sensations, and it is necessary to turn\\naround to be sure of what is taking place. Some people live in constant\\nfear of attack from behind and the backs of their bodies unconsciously\\nfreeze. Forward bending asanas release this rigidity.\\nForward bending asanas loosen up the back, maintaining good health\\nand increasing vitality.

Most people are uncoordinated in their\\nmovements so their bodies constantly have to compensate for their lack of\\nbalance in order to avoid falling or knocking things over. This inefficient\\nmethod of proceeding expends maximum effort and energy for the\\nminimum results, creating considerable additional st rain on the body.\\nThese asanas induce physical balance, stilling unconscious movement. As\\nthe moving body attains balance it becomes increasingly free to rely on\\nother forces, such as gravity, to support and propel it. This way it\\nconserves its own energyand achieves grace and fluidity of motion.\\nAs well as inducing physical balance, this group of practices develops a\\nbalanced mind and a more mature outlook on life. The focus required to\\nperform them with steadiness develops concentration and balance at th e\\nemotional, mental and psychic levels. These asanas are especially noted\\nfor balancing the nervous system and removing stress and anxiety. For\\nrelief of excessive tension these practices should be held for as long as\\npossible.\\nBalancing asanas may be diff icult to perform at first if one’s sense of\\nbalance has not been developed in normal life. However, the body is very\\nadaptable and progress will quickly be made with a few weeks of regular\\npractice.

Although this\\ninterpretation may seem correct in view of the practices involved, it does\\nnot convey the full meaning of the term. The word pranayama is\\ncomprised of two roots: prana plus ayama. Prana means ‘vital energy’ or\\n‘life force’. It is the force which exists in all things, whether animate or\\ninanimate. Although closely related to the air we breathe, it is more subtle\\nthan air or oxygen. Therefore, pranayama should not be considered as\\nmere breathing exercises aimed at introducing extra oxygen into the\\nlungs. Pranayama utilizes breathing to influence the flow of prana in the\\nnadis or energy channels of the pranamayakosha or energy body.\\nThe word yama means ‘control’ and is used to denote various rules or\\ncodes of conduct. However, this is not the word which is joined to prana\\nto form pranayama; the correct word is ayama which has far more\\nimplications than the word yama. Ayama is de fined as ‘extension’ or\\n‘expansion’. Thus, the word pranayama means ‘extension or expansion of\\nthe dimension of prana’. The techniques of pranayama provide the\\nmethod whereby the life force can be activated and regulated in order to\\ngo beyond one’s normal boundaries or limitations and attain a higher state\\nof vibratory energy.\\nFour aspects of pranayama\\nIn the pranayama practices there are four important aspects of breathing\\nwhich are utilized. These are:\\na) Pooraka or inhalation\\nb) Rechaka or exhalation\\n363'),\n",

There it another mode of pranayama\\nwhich it called kevala kumbhakaor spontaneous breath retention. This is\\nan advanced stage of pranayama which occurs during high states of\\nmeditation. During this state, the lungs stop their activity and the\\nrespiration ceases. At this time, the veil which prevents one from seeing\\nthe subtle aspect of existence is lifted and a higher vision of reality is\\nattained.\\nThe most important part of pranayama is actually kumbhaka or breath\\nretention. However, in order to perform kumbhaka successfully, there\\nmust be a gradual development of control over the function of respiration.\\nTherefore, in the pranayama practices more emphasis is given to\\ninhalation and exhalation at the beginning, in order to strengthen the lungs\\nand balance the nervous and pranic systems in preparation for the practice\\nof kumbhaka. These practices influence the flow of prana in the nadis,\\npurifying, regulating and activating t hem, thereby inducing physical and\\nmental stability.

These five sheaths are known as:\\na) Annamayakosha,the food or material body\\nb) Manomaya kosha,the mental body\\nc) Pranamaya kosha,the bioplasmic or vital energy body\\nd) Vijnanamaya kosha,the psychic or higher mental body\\ne) Anandamaya kosha,the transcendental or bliss body.\\nAlthough these five sheaths function together to form an\\nintegral whole, the practices of pranayama work mainly with pranamaya\\nkosha. The pranamaya kosha is made up of five major pranas which are\\ncollectively known as the pancha, or five, pranas: prana, apana, samana,\\nudana and vyana.\\n364'),\n",

Human beings breathe about 15 times per minute\\nand 21,600 times per day.

The first five practices given\\nin this section are preparatory techniques which introduce correct breathing\\nhabits.

The ancient yogis and rishis\\nstudied nature in great detail. They noticed that animals with a slow breath\\nrate such as pythons, elephants and tortoises have long life spans, whereas\\nthose with a fast breathing rate, such as bird s, dogs and rabbits, live for\\nonly a few years. From this observation they realized the importance of\\nslow breathing for increasing the human lifespan. Those who breathe in\\nshort, quick gasps are likely to have a shorter life span than those who\\nbreathe sl owly and deeply. On the physical level, this is because the\\nrespiration is directly related to the heart. A slow breathing rate keeps th e\\nheart stronger and better nourished and contributes to a longer life. Deep\\nbreathing also increases the absorption of energy by the pranamaya kosha,\\nenhancing dynamism, vitality and general wellbeing.\\nPranayama and the spiritual aspirant\\nPranayama practices establish a healthy body by removing blockages in the\\npranamaya kosha, enabling an increased absorption of prana. Th e spiritual\\nseeker, however, also requires tranquility of mind as an essential prelude to\\nspiritual practice. To this end, many pranayama techniques utilize\\nkumbhaka, breath retention, to establish control over the flow of prana,\\ncalming the mind and controlling the thought process.\\nOnce the mind has been stilled and prana flows freely in the nadis and\\nchakras, the doorway to the evolution of con sciousness opens, leading the\\naspirant into higher dimensions of spiritual experience. In The Science of\\nPranayama, Swami Sivananda writes, “There is an intimate connection\\nbetween the breath, nerve currents and control of the inner prana or vital\\nforces. Prana becomes visible on the physical plane as motion and action,\\n368\\nand on the mental plane as thought.'),\n",

The nose should be cleaned regularly by\\njala neti prior to the practice session. Be aware of the nostrils throughout\\nthe techniques. While inhaling, the nostrils should dilate or expand\\noutwards and while exhaling, they should relax back to their normal\\nposition.\\nTime of practice:The best time to practice pranayama is during the early\\nmorning when the body is fresh and the mind has very few impressions. If\\nthis is not possible, another good time is just after sunset. Tranquillizing\\npranayamas may be performed before sleep. Try topractice regularly at the\\nsame time and place each day. Regularity in practice increases strength and\\nwillpower as well as acclimatizing the body and mind to the increased\\npranic force. Do not be in a hurry; slow, steady progress is essential.\\nPlace of practice: Practice in a quiet, clean and pleasan t room which is\\nwell ventilated but not draughty. Generally, avoid practicing in direct\\nsunlight, as the body will become over -heated, except at dawn when the\\nsoft rays of the early morning sun are beneficial. Practicing in a draught or\\nwind, in air -conditioning or under a fan may upset the body temper ature\\nand cause chills.\\nSitting position: A comfortable, sustainable meditation posture is\\nnecessary to enable efficient breathing and body steadiness during the\\npractice. Siddha/siddha yoni asana is one of t he best postures for\\npranayama. The body should be as\\n369'),\n",

Bhastrika uses force on both inhalation and\\nexhalation, expanding and contracting the lungs above and below their\\nresting or basic volume. Kapalbhati, on the other hand, actively reduces\\nthe volume of air in the lungs below this level through forced exhalation.\\nIn this practice, inhalation remains a passive process which brings the\\nlevel of air in the lungs back to the basic volume only. This way of\\nbreathing reverses the normal breathing process which involves active\\ninhalation and passive exhalation.\\n399'),\n",

The bandhas aim\\nto lock the pranas in par ticular areas and redirect their flow into\\nsushumna nadi for the purpose of spiritual awakening.\\nBandhas may be practiced individually or incorporated with mudra\\nand pranayama practices. When combined in this way, they awaken the\\npsychic faculties and forman adjunct to higher yogic practices.\\nBandhas and the granthis\\nThere are four bandhas: jalandhara, moola, uddiyanaand maha.The last\\nof these is a combination of the first three. These three bandhas directly\\nact on the three granthisor psychic knots. Moola bandha is associated\\nwith brahma granthi, uddiyana bandha with vishnu granthi and\\njalandhara bandha with rudra granthi.

Yogis have experienced mudras as attitudes of\\nenergy flow, intended to link individual pranic force with universal or\\ncosmic force.” The KularnavaTantra traces the word mudra to the root\\nmud meaning ‘delight’ or ‘pleasure’ and dravay,the causal form of\\ndru which mea ns ‘to draw forth’. Mudra is also defined as a ‘seal,’\\n‘short-cut’ or ‘circuit by-pass.’\\nMudras are a combination of subtle physical movements which alter\\nmood, attitude and perception, and which deepen awareness and\\nconcentration. A mudra may involve the w hole body in a combination\\nof asana, pranayama, bandha and visualization techniques or it may be a\\nsimple hand position. The Hatha Yoga Pradipikaand other yogic texts\\nconsider mudra to be a yoganda, an independent branch of yoga,\\nrequiring a very subtle awareness. Mudras are introduced after some\\nproficiency has been attained in asana, pranayama and bandha, and\\ngross blockages have been removed.\\nMudras have been described in various texts from antiquity to the\\npresent day in order to preserve them for poste rity. However, such\\nreferences were never detailed or clearly delineated as these techniques\\nwere not intended to be learned from a book. Practical instruction from\\na guru was always considered to be a necessary requisite before\\nattempting them. Mudras are higher practices which lead to awakening\\nof the pranas, chakras and kundalini, and which can bestow major\\nsiddhis,psychic powers, on the advanced practitioner.\\n423'),\n",

Ultimately, it establishes pranic balance within the\\nkoshas and enables the redirection of subtle energy to the upper\\nchakras, inducing higher states of consciousness.\\nMudras manipulate prana in much the same way that energy in the\\nform of light or sound waves is diverted by a mirror or a cliff face . The\\nnadis and chakras constantl y radiate prana which normally escapes\\nfrom the body and dissipates into the external world. B y creating\\nbarriers within the body through the practice of mudra, the energy is\\nredirected within. For example, by closing the eyes with the fingers in\\nshanmukhi mudra, the prana being radiated through the eyes is\\nreflected back. In the same way, the sexu al energy emitted through\\nvajra nadi is redirected to the brain through the practice of vajroli\\nmudra.\\nTantric literature states that once the dissipation of prana is arrested\\nthrough the practice of mudra, the mind becomes introverted, inducing\\nstates of pratyahara, or sense withdrawal and dharana, concentration.\\nBecause of their ability to redirect prana, mudras are important\\ntechniques for awakening kundalini. For this reason they are\\nextensively incorporated in kriya and kundalini yoga practices.\\nA scientific look at mudras\\nIn scientific terms, mudras provide a means to access and influence the\\nunconscious reflexes and primal, instinctive habit patterns that originate\\nin the primitive areas of the brain around the brain stem. They establish\\na subtle, non -intellectual connection with these areas. Each mudra sets\\nup a different link and has a correspondingly different effect on the\\nbody, mind and prana. The aim is to create fixed, repetitive postures\\nand gestures which can snap the practitioner out of instinc tive habit\\npatterns and establish a more refined consciousness.\\n424'),\n",

Always ensure\\nthat, although the e yes are closed, they are still gazing upward\\ninternally.\\nPractice note: Shambhavi mudra is an integral part of kriya yoga. It is a\\npowerful technique for awakening ajna chakra and is a meditation\\npractice in its own right. As such it may produce profound e xperiences\\nwhen performed for long periods of time; however, it should only be\\nperformed under the guidance of a guru.

His ancestors were warriors and many of his kith \\nand kin down the line, including his fa ther, served in the army and police \\nforce. \\nHowever, it became evident that Sri Swamiji had a different bent o f \\nmind, as he began to have spiritual e xperiences at the age of six, when his \\nawareness spontaneously left the body and he saw himself lying motionless \\non the floor. Many saints and sadhus blessed him and reassured his parents \\nthat he had a very developed awaren ess. This experience of disembodied \\nawareness continued, which led him to many saints of that time such as \\nAnandamayi Ma. Sri Swamiji also met a tantric bhairavi, Sukhman Giri, \\nwho gave him shaktipat and directed him to find a guru in order to stabilize \\nhis spiritual experiences. \\nIn 1943, at the age of 20, he renounced his home and went in search of a \\nguru. This search ultimately led him to Swami Sivananda Saraswati at \\nRishikesh, who initiated him into the Dashnam Order of Sannyasa on 12th \\nSeptember 1947 on the banks of the Ganges and gave him the name Swami \\nSatyananda Saraswati. \\nIn those early years at Rishikesh, Sr i Swamiji immersed himself in guru \\nseva. At that time the ashram was s till in its infancy and even the basic \\namenities such as buildings and toilets were absent. The forests \\nsurrounding the small ashram were infested with snakes, scorpions, \\nmosquitoes, monkeys and even tigers. The ashram work too was heavy and \\nhard, requiring Sri Swamiji to toil like a laborer carrying bucket loads o f \\nwater from the Ganga up to the ashr am and digging canals from the high \\nmountain streams down to the ashram ma ny kilometers away in order to \\nstore water for constructing the ashram. \\nRishikesh was then a small town and all the ashram requirements had to \\nbe brought by foot from far away. In addition there were varied duties, \\nincluding the daily pooja at Vishwanath'),\n",

Swami Satyananda \\nis full of Nachiketa vairagya.\" \\nAlthough he had a photographic memory and a keen intellect, and his guru \\ndescribed him as a versatile genius, Swami Satyananda\\'s learning did not \\ncome from books and study in the ashram.

You \\ndo not have to search for the light, the light will unfold from within you.\" \\nIn 1956, after spending twelve years in guru seva, Swami Satyananda set \\nout as a wanderer (parivrajaka). Be fore his departure Swami Sivananda \\ntaught him kriya yoga and gave him the mission to \"spread yoga from door to \\ndoor and shore to shore\". \\nAs a wandering sannyasin, Swami Satyananda travelled extensively by foot, \\ncar, train and sometimes even by camel throughout India, Afghanistan,\\nBurma, Nepal, Tibet, Ceylon and the entire Asian subcontinent.

It propounds the tapovan style of living adopted by the rishis \\nand munis of the vedic era and is intended only for sannyasins, renunciates, \\nascetics, tapasvis and paramahamsas. The Alakh Bara does not conduct any \\nactivities such as yoga teaching or preaching of any religion or religious \\nconcepts. The guidelines set down for the Alakh Bara are based on the classical \\nvedic tradition of sadhana, tapasya and swadhyaya, or atma chintan. \\nSwami Satyananda, who resides permanently at the Alakh Bara, has performed \\nthe Panchagni Vidya and other vedic sadhanas, thus paving the way for future \\nparamahamsas to uphold their tradition. \\nBIHAR YOGA BHARATI (BYB) \\nBihar Yoga Bharati was founded by Swami Niranjanananda in 1994 as an \\neducational and charitable institution for advanced studies in yogic sciences.

It offers a complete scientific and yogic education according to \\nthe needs of today, through the faculties of Yoga Philosophy, Yoga Psychology, \\nApplied Yogic Science and Yogic Ecology. \\nResidential courses of four months to two years are conducted in a gurukul \\nenvironment, so that along with yoga education, the spirit of seva (selfless \\nservice), samarpan (dedication) and karuna (compassion) for humankind is also \\nimbibed by the students.\"),\n",
